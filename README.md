d-RAGS is an efficient replanning version of the risk aware graph (RAGS) algorithm in the [paper by Chung et al.]( https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364918781009). Here is my poster briefly explaining how this works - [link to poster](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aXctcioaOnPRl-dboFBwhloqfJt6D5Mfge8cmZ_7TS4/edit?usp=sharing) . I will attach a link to my paper with a complete description of the algorithm soon.

To run, install the requirements from requirements.txt and run main.py
