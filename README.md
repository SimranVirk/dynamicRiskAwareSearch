# dynamic_rags

(Work in Progess)

This is a python implementation of the RAGS (Risk aware graph search) algorithm in the paper titled
'Risk-aware graph search with dynamic edge cost discovery' by Chung et al.

It will include my own version of RAGS that is able to efficiently dynamically update its plan as well
as a comparison between the two algorithms (and some other algorithms used for path finding in the 
presence of dynamic obstacle avoidance and in path finding to maximize information gain from the 
environment).
