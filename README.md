This is an efficient replanning version of the risk aware graph (RAGS) algorithm in the paper by Chung et al. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364918781009

I've implemented d-RAGS which is able to efficiently replan upon receiving edge weight updates. Here is my poster briefly explaining how this works - . I will attach a link to my poster with a complete description of the algorithm soon.

To run, install the requirements from requirements.txt and run main.py
